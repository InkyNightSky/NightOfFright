Night of Fright is a VR game where you must fight off ghosts with your flashlight, and solve the correct code written on the door in order to input codes into the keypad. Once the right code is typed, you win!

The design objective of this project was to create a tense atmosphere that is spooky without being frightening, while giving players a challenge and making them think. 

Future work would be to make a new keypad model, and potentially add more puzzles to the game to expand upon it.
